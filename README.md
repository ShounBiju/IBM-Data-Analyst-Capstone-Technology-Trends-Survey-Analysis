## 🧠 Project Description

This repository contains my final capstone analysis for the **IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate**. The goal was to clean, analyze, and visualize a large developer survey dataset to uncover:

- Technology adoption patterns
- Future interest in languages, databases, platforms, and frameworks
- Demographic distributions across respondents

The analytics workflow includes:
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** using Python (Pandas)  
2. **Ranking Current & Future Technology Trends**  
3. **Generating CSV outputs for visual dashboards**  
4. **Presenting results in both a Dashboard PDF and Executive Presentation**

The **cleaned datasets**, **Python notebook**, **dashboard**, and **presentation** are all linked above for easy review.
